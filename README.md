# Snort Configuration Fixes

This repository contains a fixed and optimized version of the **`snort.conf`** file. The original configuration was causing issues, including performance bottlenecks and missed alerts. This version has been meticulously reviewed and corrected to ensure Snort runs efficiently and accurately.

#

### Key Fixes and Optimizations

* **Rule Path Correction:** Ensured all rule paths are correctly pointed to their respective directories. This fixes common "rule not found" errors.
* **Performance Tuning:** Adjusted settings like `config event_queue` and `config preprocessor` to optimize Snort's performance on modern systems, reducing CPU usage without sacrificing detection capabilities.
* **Preprocessor Configuration:** Enabled and properly configured key preprocessors, such as `stream5` and `http_inspect`, to improve the accuracy of network traffic analysis.
* **Variable Standardization:** Standardized the use of variables like `HOME_NET` and `EXTERNAL_NET` to prevent misconfigurations and simplify future rule management.
* **Unified Logging:** Consolidated logging settings to create a more consistent and usable output for analysis and SIEM integration.
